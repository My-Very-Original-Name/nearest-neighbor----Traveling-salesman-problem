# Nearest-neighbor-algorithm-(TSP)
[This was a school project]

For the version with italian variable names, check the "Italiano" folder.

The repository contains both the simple algoritm function and the whole program, the function accepts a list of tuples containing the coordinates of the points (x , y) and returns the total distance and final path as a list containing the point's number as indicated from it's position in the points[] list. (for instance, in the list [(1, 4) , (5, 9)] point 0 would be (1, 4) )
