# Nearest-neighbor-algorithm-(TSP)

The repository contains both the algoritm function and a possible implementation, the function accepts a list of tuples containing the coordinates of the points (x , y) and returns the total distance and final path as a list containing the point's number as indicated from it's position in the points[] list. (for instance, in the list [(1, 4) , (5, 9)] point 0 would be (1, 4) )
